									<h1>"Thoughts"</h1>

								<p>“To really change the world, we have to help people change the way they see things. Global betterment is a mental process, not one that requires huge sums of money or a high level of authority. Change has to be psychological. So if you want to see real change, stay persistent in educating humanity on how similar we all are than different. Don't only strive to be the change you want to see in the world, but also help all those around you see the world through commonalities of the heart so that they would want to change with you. This is how humanity will evolve to become better. This is how you can change the world. The language of the heart is mankind's main common language.”</p>
								<h2>Planing</h2>
								<p>The dividing line is not between those who want to change the world and those who do not — there is no one whose heart still pounds in their chest who can view the ravages of war, suffering and injustice without wishing that things could be different. The dividing line, then, is between the warriors of hope who believe that another world is both possible and necessary, and the many who have given up and abandoned this dream to the lures of cynism, distraction or despair.</p>
